# Trading LikeCoin

### Exchanges supporting LikeCoin 

[BitAsset](https://www.bitasset.com) supports TWD/LIKE and BTC/LIKE trading pairs. [MyEthShop](https://www.myethshop.com) provides HKD/LIKE exchange. [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) supports BTC/LIKE and USDT/LIKE trading pairs. Those who are interested can buy or sell LikeCoin with them.

### LikeCoin ERC-20

Some of the crypto exchanges do not support LikeCoin from the LikeCoin chain, listing the old version ERC-20 LikeCoin, e.g. [IDEX](https://idex.market/eth/like). BitAseet and MyEthShop provide ERC-20 gateway for exchanging, but after transaction the LikeCoin will be on the LikeCoin chain as well..

Transferring LikeCoin requires the use of Liker Land mobile app and [LIKE pay](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/like-pay), please do download it first.
