For trading LikeCoin into TWD or BTC, the most convenient way is going through [BitAsset](https://www.bitasset.com/) exchange, as they offer LIKE/TWD exchange pairs. If you do not have a BitAsest account, please take a look at [this](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/likecoin-token/registering-on-bitasset). Moreover, you have to download the Liker Land mobile app to send/receive LikeCoin.

### Step 1: Find your LikeCoin wallet on BitAseet account

First of all you have to find your wallet address on BitAsset so as to transfer LikeCoin to the exchange.

Login BitAsset and click on the top right hand corner of your email address/ID, then click "User" and go into the Personal information page. Click "My wallet" to access the wallet page.

Transfer is done within two minutes.

Next step is to wait for BitAsset to confirm the transfer.

### Step 3: Confirm the transfer to BitAsset

Less than 5 minutes the LikeCoin is transferred to BitAsset, you can check your wallet balance following Step 1.

![The transfer is completed, your wallet balance is no longer zero](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LL4mdaVjNgL6A1--PV0%2F-MDK0P7Hgcu5426KHOXA%2F-MDK1wioeImSpU3R-DVw%2Fbitasset-trade-9.png?alt=media&token=cc6a0669-34c2-4215-9a04-5f3127225c9f)

### Step 4: Buy or Sell

Click "Spot Trading" on the top left hand corner, find "LIKE" on the top left corner search box, choose "TWD" or "BTC" on the drop down box, depending on what currency you would like to exchange with.

![On the top left hand corner, select trading pairs](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LL4mdaVjNgL6A1--PV0%2F-MDK0P7Hgcu5426KHOXA%2F-MDK23c-p5NwvYuDayok%2Fbitasset-trade-10.png?alt=media&token=e9258d5e-d72e-4c82-ae54-8db44eb3993f)

Choose your trading pairs and take a look at the order book. The figures in red are those orders who want to "Sell", for example below there are people who want to sell 252 LikeCoin at the price of 0.21 TWD/LIKE, and then some other people want to sell 52,565 LikeCoin at 0.212 TWD/LIKE. If you want to buy 50,000 LikeCoin, you can buy them all at 0.212 TWD/LIKE.

If you want to sell your LikeCoin, you have to monitor the seller in green. For example below if you want to sell 50,000 LikeCoin, it is guaranteed to be sold at 0.0831 TWD/LIKE because the highest selling price is 0.0831 to buy 296,468 LikeCoin.

![Sell, check out the orders below in green, Buy, check out the orders above in red](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LL4mdaVjNgL6A1--PV0%2F-MDK0P7Hgcu5426KHOXA%2F-MDK29eYzwfMz9U4AcOB%2Fbitasset-trade-11.png?alt=media&token=311f411c-0ebc-44f4-8f37-26aff0190f12)

Once you decide the price and amount to buy or sell, click on the "Order form" on the left to confirm. Let use "Limit" as an example.

You have to input 3 parameters:

1. Select the right action for "Buy LIKE" or "Sell LIKE
2. Input "Price": using the order book above as example, fill in 0.0831 for selling LikeCoin
3. Input "Amount": Fill in 50000 for selling 50,000 LikeCoin, or click a percentage e.g. 100%, 50%, etc

The system will calculate "Total", confirm if they are correct or not, then click "Sell Like" to complete the transaction.
