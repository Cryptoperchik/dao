委託能獲得回報，因為每位委託者都在幫忙記帳。

委託 LikeCoin 會有回報，本文會解釋這筆錢從何而來。由於所有參數日後均能透過社群自治機制改動，請留意本文所舉的數字僅反映目前 \( 2019 Dec \) 情況。  
  
Validator's rewards for recording all transactions is from [inflation](https://docs.like.co/constitution#9e68). currently set up as 1% of the total LikeCoin circulation, which is ten million out of one billion LikeCoin.

The inflation amount will be distributed when a block is created in LikeCoin chain, approximately in every 5-6 seconds

2% of the newly minted LikeCoin from inflation will be treated as "Tax" and reserved for Community Pool. In other words, 98% of LikeCoin from inflation is for validators and stakeholders. Usage of the Community Pool will be determined accordingly to the community's autonomous mechanisms.

If a block is created on every 6 seconds, the number of new blocks created per year are 365\*24\*60\*10 = 5,256,000, therefore the LikeCoin shared to each validators and stakeholders from each block are:

= 10,000,000 LikeCoin x 98% / 5,256,000

= 1.86 LikeCoin

That means 1.86 LikeCoin is minted every 6 seconds for validators and stakeholders to distribute according to their delegation ratio. Currently the commission rate is 50%, therefore the LikeCoin given to stakeholders on every 6 seconds is 1.86/2 = 0.93.

The above calculation based on the assumption of a new block is created every 6 second, but in fact there are deviations in real life. Adding to the 98% from inflation, 98% transaction fee from each transaction will also be distributed to validators and stakeholders according to their delegation ratio.
