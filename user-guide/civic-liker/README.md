## [**Join Civic Liker**](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/civic-liker/be-a-civic-liker)

Civic Liker is a movement to reward open contents, positioned as "a tool to encourage open subscription". Content creator can build his/her own paid supporting community in any platform, create an environment to focus on content creation and survive with sable income. For the cost from a cup of coffee to a bottle of campaign, you become a Civic Liker. Whatever you Like will then be turned into a tangible reward to creators.

### **Monthly fee support the designated creator**

The monthly supporting amount for LikeCoin will be credited to the content creator in full amount.\* The income is in proportion to the number of Civic Likers that support him/her and will be received in due course. Moreover, Civic Liker is still able to affect the daily creators fund distribution by their claps to the content so that creator can earn extra income.

### **Share sponsor link in any medium**

No matter the content is in what kind of format or if the platform supporting LikeCoin button or not, content creator can easily establish their own Civic Liker monthly payment supporting group. Content creator can share his/her sponsor link \(Format: https://liker.land/\[Your Liker ID\]/civic \) in any channels and medium, even in Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Line or Telegram. And of course, platforms supporting the LikeCoin button can also earn extra LikeCoin from Creators Fund.
