### What is Civic Liker <a href="#what-is-civic-liker" id="what-is-civic-liker"></a>

Civic Liker is a movement to reward good content and encourage openness. You can become a Civic Liker by staking at least 5,000 LikeCoin to the “Civic Liker” node, which takes 100% stake reward as commission, with a Liker ID tied to the staking wallet address. The stake reward can then be distributed to the creators you “likes” via the LikeCoin button, without spending the staked principle.

### Like = Reward <a href="#like-reward" id="like-reward"></a>

“LikeCoin button” is a button embedded in an article so that readers can reward creators by giving likes. **The more you stake to the “Civic Liker” node, the more you can reward to creators.**

### Creators Fund <a href="#creators-fund" id="creators-fund"></a>

Besides the stake reward to be distributed to creators, the likes also serve as “votes” to affect Creators Fund’s distribution. **The more LikeCoin Civic Liker stakes, the higher voting power he/she gets.**

The Creators Fund will be distributed to the creators at around 12:00 GMT+8 everyday.

Creators Fund is a fund granted by the LikeCoin community to support creativity. The monthly budget is roughly matched with the stake reward generated by all Civic Likers in the past month. The usage of the fund will be reviewed regularly by the Creators Fund Committee established under [proposal #23](https://stake.like.co/proposals/23) of LikeCoin DAO.

### A brief history of Civic Liker <a href="#a-brief-history-of-civic-liker" id="a-brief-history-of-civic-liker"></a>

CivicLiker movement started on 2019.01.01, readers could join a $5 monthly subscription plan by credit card and reward creators by liking. Up till 2022 Feb, Civic Liker has rewarded 50 million LikeCoin to 24,000 creators.

The Civic Liker plan moved to a Web3 version on 2022.02.21, which implemented the feature of distributing stake-reward to creators, and stopped supporting credit card payment. This is also called the “Civic Liker Web3 beta”.

\*The monthly supporting amount (deducting the credit card transaction fee) will be changed to LikeCoin. Creators from all around the world can trade LikeCoin to any currencies.&#x20;
