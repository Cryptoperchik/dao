## [Be a** Civic Liker**](be-a-civic-liker.md)

Civic Liker is a movement to reward good content and encourage openness. The Civic Liker monthly subscription plan provides a convenient way for supporters to sponsor creators by monthly subscription, and let the creators focus on their work with decent rewards. Readers can pay for at least the cost of a coffee, or up to the cost of a bottle of champagne, to support creators.

### **Monthly subscription fee for designated creators**

The creators get the monthly sponsorship on a fixed date of their billing cycle. Equivalent amount of LikeCoin will be transferred to creators' wallet. Civic Likers also has the prestige power to vote for the daily distribution of the Creator's Fund by clicking LikeCoin buttons on any creative works.

### **Support content creators via any platforms **

No matter the content is in what kind of format or if the platform supports a LikeCoin button or not, readers can still support the content creator. By clicking [sponsor link ](../creatortools/sponsor-link.md)of the content creator in any channels and medium such as Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Line or Telegram ( Format: https://liker.land/\[Your Liker ID]/civic ), readers become one of the sponsor of the content creator's Civic Liker monthly payment supporting group. And of course, clapping for the content creators in platforms supporting the LikeCoin button can also let them earn extra LikeCoin reward from Creators Fund.

### **Encourage openness and diversity**

We believe every penny has to be utilized to encourage openness and diversity, content creators should keep on creating in their familiar platform and publish their works as usual. It is not necessary for them to forfeit the engagement rate and get paid by keeping their work behind paywall. And of course, only open part of their works to the Civic Liker program is another option.

Encouraging more Civic Likers to participante is to encourage more open and viewable content.
