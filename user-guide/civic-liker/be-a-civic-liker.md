# How to be a Civic Liker

Before becoming a Civic Liker, please [register a Liker ID](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-id/register).

Users stake at least **5,000 LIKE** to the “Civic Liker node”, with the wallet address tied with a Liker ID. All delegation rewards from Civic Liker will be distributed to creators in the form of LIKE. There is no need to use the delegation principal, and only the delegation rewards can turn likes into income.

Based on the current commission rate of about 15%, the monthly rewards that 5000 LIKE can generate is equal to 5000\*0.15/12 = 62.5 LIKE, which is about US$1.5 per month at the current exchange rate. The more to delegate, the more Likes to turn into actual income.

The table below is a trial calculation of the rewards generated by different delegated amounts. Please note that there is no "Ranking" system for Civic Liker, and the only effect of delegating more LikeCoin is rewarding more to the creators.

| Delegation (LIKE)	 | Monthly Rewards (LIKE) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 5000               | 62.5 (\~1.5 USD)       |
| 10000              | 125 (\~3 USD)          |
| 25000              | 312.5 (\~7.5 USD)      |
| 50000              | 625 (\~15 USD)         |
| 100000             | 1250 (\~30 USD)        |

Civic Liker can distribute the delegation rewards, but also distribute the [Creators Fund](creators-fund.md). The influence of clicking the LikeCoin button on the allocation of funds will vary with the delegation amount. Stake more, reward more, and have greater power to vote in LikeCoin DAO and for Creators Fund distribution.

## Delegate to be a Civic Liker with the Liker Land app

For details, please refer to the [Delegation of LikeCoin](../../general-guides/stake/delegation-of-likecoin.md), and select the Civic Liker node to delegate.

{% hint style="success" %}
Civic Liker will take effect within 24 hours after the delegation is completed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the user has already delegated to another validator, please [redelegate](../../general-guides/stake/redelegation-of-likecoin.md) instead of undelegate, otherwise you will need to wait for a 21-days cooling-off period before you can use the funds again.
