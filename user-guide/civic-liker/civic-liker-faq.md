# Civic Liker 2.0 FAQ

On December 21, 2020 Civic Liker evolved to Civic Liker 2.0. Have questions about the new scheme? Check out the following FAQ.

#### 1. I am a Civic Liker already, what is the Civic Liker 2.0 impact on me?

If the Civic Liker does not unsubscribe from the Civic Liker Classic, the mechanism of disturbing monthly fee by claps will remain the same.

#### 2. Can I still join the Civic Liker 1.0 old scheme now?

Civic Liker 2.0 is to arouse the interest of content creators to attract their own Civic Liker and make it easier to understand. However, we do understand that many users may prefer the old scheme. If you still want to join Civic Liker Classic, you may donate 5 USD per month. The sum will be distributed to different creators based on your claps/likes, or pay 15,000 LikeCoin or HK$468 yearly fee.
