# Creators Fund

![](../../.gitbook/assets/creators\_reward\_artwork.png)

Creator's reward consists of two parts: Civic Liker monthly subscription and Creators Fund.

The funding source is from LikeCoin community pool, budget is roughly matched with the fiat revenue amount of Civic Liker. A fixed amount of fund is distributed to creators daily according to the total likes given by Civic Likers and Free Likers on previous day.

Civic Likers have much greater weight than free Liker in Fund distribution.

Creators can [check their Creators Fund reward](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creatortools/rewards) in Liker Land app.
