# Register a Liker ID with Keplr

Besides [registering with an email, GMail or Social Media Login](register.md), users can now register with Keplr and manage their LikeCoin in a decentralized way with their own private key. Registering with Keplr does not require email or any other personal details, users only have to use Keplr on sign up/login. Keplr only supports registering a new Liker ID at this moment.
