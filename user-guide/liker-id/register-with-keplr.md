# Register a Liker ID with Keplr

Besides [registering with an email, GMail or Social Media Login](register.md), users can now register with Keplr and manage their LikeCoin in a decentralized way with their own private key. Registering with Keplr does not require email or any other personal details, users only have to use Keplr on sign up/login.

Go to the Chrome Webstore and click "Add to Chrome" to install the [Keplr extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap).

**Important Notes**

1. Keplr only supports registering a new Liker ID; current Liker IDs are not able to bind with Keplr.
2. Liker ID registered by Keplr cannot login Liker Land mobile app or use it's functions such as checking rewards on a daily or weekly basis,  and also cannot connect to other social profiles such as Facebook or Apple ID.
3. Since registering a Liker ID with Keplr does not require an email,  if you do not add the email and confirm it, you will not receive [Liker Land monthly reports](../creatortools/monthly-report.md) and LikeCoin transaction notice.
4. If you have to receive transaction notice, Liker Land monthly reports and news updated, please input your email in settings and authenticate it.
5. An email address cannot register a Liker ID with Keplr and Liker Land at the same time.
