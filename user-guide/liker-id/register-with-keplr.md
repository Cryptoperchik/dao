# Register a Liker ID with Keplr

Besides [registering with email/passowrd, GMail or social media account](register.md), user can also register with Keplr and manage their LikeCoin in a more decentralized way and keep their own private key. Choose "Sign in with your wallet" on the top right corner of the login screen to sign up/login by Keplr.  Note that user can choose either method (General Registration, or Keplr) for Liker ID registration, the two login methods cannot be interchanged for a given Liker ID once it has been confirmed.
