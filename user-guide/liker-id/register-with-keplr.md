# Register a Liker ID with Keplr

Besides [registering with an email, GMail or Social Media Login](register.md), users can now register with Keplr and manage their LikeCoin in a decentralized way with their own private key. Users can choose "Sign in with your wallet" on the top right hand corner during sign up/login. Keplr currently supports registering a new Liker ID or bond your existing Keplr wallet with a Liker ID (Skip Step 1).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/keplr04.png)

Fill in your Account name, password and click "Next", after validating the seed phrase, the wallet interface of Keplr appears.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please keep your seed phase and password in a safe place. If you forget them you are not able to manage your LikeCoin. No one can reset your wallet for you.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Register a Liker ID

On [Liker Land web](https://liker.land), click "Sign up".

![](../../.gitbook/assets/keplr-liker-id-00-en.png)

On the top right hand corner, click "Sign in with your wallet".

![](../../.gitbook/assets/keplr-liker-id-01-en.png)

Click "Sign up with Keplr".

Liker ID is created and will go back to the Liker Land web.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once a Liker ID has been created, the letter combination and login method cannot be changed.  We suggest you keep it, or just create another one. Please note that an email address can only register one Liker ID.

You cannot use the same email address to register a Liker ID with Authcore and Keplr.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Check the Wallet

On Liker Land Web settings, your LikeCoin wallet address is the same as the Keplr address, which means you successfully register your Liker ID with Keplr.
