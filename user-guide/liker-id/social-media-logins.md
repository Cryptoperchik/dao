## Why blinding different social media logins:

There are two benefits blinding your social media logins:

1. You don't have to input email address and password, just use your usual social media account to login.
2. Protect access to your Liker ID, if there is an issue with one of the login method, e.g. forget passowrd, or the platform itself has technical problem, you can still use your other social meida logins to access your Liker ID.

## Blinding Method \(Except Matters\)

### Step 1

Login [https://like.co/in/settings](https://like.co/in/settings), go to AuthCore Settings, click "Security settings", or open the Liker Land mobile app, click on the avatar at the lower right hand corner and select \[Account Settings\], then click "Social logins".
