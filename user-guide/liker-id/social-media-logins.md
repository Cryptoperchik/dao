# Connecting to my social profile

## Why linking different social media logins:

There are two benefits linking your social media logins:

1. You don't have to input email address and password, just use your usual social media account to login.
2. Protect access to your Liker ID, if there is an issue with one of the login methods, e.g. forget password, or the platform itself has technical problems, you can still use other social media logins to access your Liker ID.

## Linking Method \(Except Matters\)

### Step 1

Login [Liker Land](https://liker.land/) and go to [https://like.co/in/settings](https://like.co/in/settings), go to "AuthCore Settings", click "Security settings", or open the Liker Land mobile app, click on setting at the lower right hand corner and select \[Security\], then click \[Social Account login\].
