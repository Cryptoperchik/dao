# Register Liker ID by general method (with Authcore)

Using [Liker Land mobile app](https://liker.land/getapp) or [Liker Land web](https://liker.land/civic) can both register Liker ID by general method (with Authcore). However this login method will slowly fade out. Users are advised to export your seed words from Authcore and import them into Keplr in order to manage your LikeCoin.
