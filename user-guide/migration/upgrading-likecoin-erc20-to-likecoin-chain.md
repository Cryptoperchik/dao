# Assisted Migration

LikeCoin has been migrated to the LikeCoin chain and users no longer need MetaMask to login but should use Liker Land mobile app instead.  This document is for legacy users who created Liker ID with MetaMask and did not complete the Liker ID migration process only.

For those who fulfil the below conditions:

1. Have LikeCoin on MetaMask
2. Have bound your Liker ID with at least one social accounts \(Google/Facebook/Twitter/Matters\) besides MetaMask

### Step 1: Visit Like.co/in <a id="step-1-visit-likecoin-"></a>

Your task is to upgrade the LikeCoin in your MetaMask wallet to LikeCoin chain, so the first step is to make sure that you have the MetaMask with the correct wallet address installed in your Chrome browser.

Login Liker Land by Chrome with your social account \(Google / Facebook / Twitter / Matters\) and go to [https://like.co/in/](https://like.co/in/).  The system will pop up the below screen \(probably in English\).

### Step 2.1: Read the introduction <a id="step-21-read-the-introduction"></a>

The system will lead you to the migration page and help you upgrade your LikeCoin step by step.  After reading the background introduction in the below screen, click "Confirm".

### Step 2.2: Sign

The system is going to perform a transaction from your MetaMask, and need your signature for authorization. Click "Sign".

After clicking "Sign", the following MetaMask screens will be shown.  Click "Connect" and then "Sign".

### Step 2.3: Waiting for the upgrading process to be finished <a id="step-23-waiting-for-the-upgrading-process-to-be-finished"></a>

In this step, the system will firstly transfer your LikeCoin ERC-20 to a smart contract, and then deposit LikeCoin to your new wallet on the LikeCoin chain.  The process needs a few minutes, please be patient.
