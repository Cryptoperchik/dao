# Content Creators

As a Decentralized Publishing Infrastructure, LikeCoin provides Decentralized Registry, Decentralized Rewards and Decentralized Editorial for content creators.

## Decentralized Registry

* Help creators to write content to IPFS
* Achieve through [Matters](https://matters.news/)
* For [WordPress](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creator/wordpress) at the moment

## Decentralized Rewards

* **Reinventing the Like**：By simply attaching a [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creatoir) beneath your content and without setting up a paywall, every Like by readers is turned into measurable rewards in LikeCoin tokens.
* Rewards to creators are from two sources, [Civic Liker](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/civic-liker) contribute USD5/mo、USD20/mo、USD100/mo to reward creativity and journalism, while the creators fund, distributed according to the Likes of all users, doubles the rewarding pool.

## Decentralized Editorial

* [Liker Land](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/today-headline): "Not Browsing, But Reading", our mobile app designed to be scarce to cut out noise from signals.
* Apart from rewarding creators as a Liker, readers may go further to become a [Content Jockey](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/superlike), help distribute creative stories and insightful commentaries with Super Likes.
