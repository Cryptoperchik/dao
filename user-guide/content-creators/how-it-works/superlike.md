### Browsing, is for reading

The time for daily reading is limited and you are not able to digest the ocean of knowledge. Moreover, speed reading won't make you smarter. Liker Land helps readers to precisely follow the content that they love, spending their valuable time on deep reading.

### **Sharing, is to inspire**

Every Super Like shares the same content to Liker Land, and attracts friends with similar tastes. The quota of the Super Like is limited each day, only your favourite contents can be shared to others.

### Like, is to reward

Super Like redefines the definition of "Share", Share = Rewards. Not only creators earn rewards, content jockeys who share the piece of content can earn rewards too.

## Usage <a id="zen-yang-can-yu"></a>

_Easy to understand_: Clicking the LikeCoin button on the 6th time and you are giving Super Like.

_Explained in details_: If you are a Civic Liker, when you click the LikeCoin button for the 5th time, the LikeCoin button icon will turn into a star totem. When you click the 6th time, you "Super Like" that article. A tick will then appears on the star totem representing one chance of Super Like is being utilized, the RSS icon turned on and the article will be shared to Liker Land.

Super Like will be reset at 12:00 noon and midnight. The outer green circle of the LikeCoin button is a progress bar to indicate the time of the reset occurs. Super Like cannot be accumulated, if it is not being used before the time to reset, it will be obsolete. You can only Super Like twice a day while you can Super Like a single article for more than one time.
