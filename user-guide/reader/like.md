# Like - Turn "Likes" into Rewards

Any website embedded with a LikeCoin button can reinvent the likes, each clap can support the content creators and turn likes into actual income.

Using the [Liker Land mobile app](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/reader/download) to surf for articles, you can easily clap /"Like" and support the creators. When a [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creator/likecoin-button) is embedded in an article, it can be clapped by a Liker 1â€“5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the Creators Pool allocated for that day. If you are a [Civic Liker](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/civic-liker), the creator will receive LikeCoin right away. If you are an ordinary Liker, the creator will receive his/her daily Creators Fund's distribution on the next day afternoon.

Furthermore, creators receive Liker Land [monthly reports](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creator/monthly-report) from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Readers can also send LikeCoin to creator directly via [LIKE Pay](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/likecoin-token/like-pay).
