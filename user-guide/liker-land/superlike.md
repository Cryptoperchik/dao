![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LL4mdaVjNgL6A1--PV0%2F-MDKKfTTMClruYgMEN2z%2F-MDKL9uOAcQBWwTt-7PY%2Flikecoin_ad92\_super_like_dragonball.png?alt=media\&token=aebf61cf-24c0-4d70-9cce-a582d82122e8)

## Concept

Clicking on the LikeCoin button for the 6th time, _**share your favourite, worth exploring contents to Liker Land.**_

### Browsing, is for reading&#xD;

The time for daily reading is limited and you are not able to digest the ocean of knowledge. Moreover, speed reading won't make you smarter. Liker Land helps readers to precisely follow the content that they love, spending their valuable time on deep reading.

### **Sharing, is to inspire**

Every Super Like shares the same content to Liker Land, and attracts friends with similar tastes. The quota of the Super Like is limited each day, only your favourite contents can be shared to others.

### Like, is to reward&#xD;

Super Like redefines the definition of "Share", Share = Rewards. Not only creators earn rewards, content jockeys who share the piece of content can earn rewards too.

## Usage <a href="zen-yang-can-yu" id="zen-yang-can-yu"></a>

* Clicking the LikeCoin button for the 5th time, the LikeCoin button icon will turn into a star totem. When clicking on the 6th time, the article is being "Super Liked".
* The "Super Liked" article will be on Liker Land. Your followers can see it on "[My Content Jockey](today-headline.md#my-content-jockey)"  and everyone can see it on "[The world has Super Liked](today-headline.md#the-world-has-super-liked)".

* A tick will then appear on the star totem representing one chance of Super Like is being utilized. Super Like will be reset at 12:00 noon and midnight. The outer green circle of the LikeCoin button is a progress bar to indicate the time of the reset occurs. 
* The RSS icon on the lower right hand corner turned on and the article is being shared to Liker Land.
* Super Like cannot be accumulated, if it is not being used before the time to reset, it will be obsolete. You can only Super Like twice a day.
