# Reading and Rewarding

Using [Liker Land mobile app](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/liker-land-mobile-app) to surf for articles, you can easily clap /"Like" and support the creators. A content can be clapped by a Liker 1â€“5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the Creators Pool allocated for that day. If you are a Civic Liker, the creator will receive LikeCoin right away. If you are an ordinary Liker, creator will receive his/her daily Creators Fund's distribution on the next day afternoon.

Furthermore, creators receive Liker Land [monthly reports](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/faq/monthly-report) from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Reader can also send LikeCoin to creator directly via [LIKE Pay](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/like-pay).
