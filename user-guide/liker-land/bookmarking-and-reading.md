# Reading and Rewarding

以 [Liker Land 手機應用程式閱讀文章](https://docs.like.co/v/zh/user-guide/liker-land/discovering-contents)，可方便地拍手讚賞作者。文章中凡出現[讚賞鍵](https://docs.like.co/v/zh/user-guide/likecoin-button)，便可以拍手 1 至 5 次，每次拍掌都為產生作者的收入。若你是[讚賞公民](https://docs.like.co/v/zh/user-guide/civic-liker)，作者會立即收到 LikeCoin 奬勵；若你是免費 Liker，作者也能於翌日下午收到來自月費配對基金的奬勵。

Using [Liker Land mobile app](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/liker-land-mobile-app) to surf for articles, you can easily clap and support the creators. A content can be clapped by a Liker 1–5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the Creators Pool allocated for that day. If you are a Civic Liker, the creator will receive LikeCoin right away. If you are an ordinary Liker, creater will receive his/her daily Creators Fund's distribution on next day afternoon.

Furthermore, creators receive Liker Land monthly reports from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Reader can also send LikeCoin to creator directly via LIKE Pay.
