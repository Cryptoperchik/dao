# Like - Reinventing the Like

Any website embedded with a LikeCoin button can turn "Likes" into rewards, each clap can support the content creators and turn likes into actual income.

Using the [Liker Land mobile app to surf for articles](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/liker-land/today-headline), you can easily clap /"Like" and support the creators. When a [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creatoir) is embedded in an article, it can be clapped by a Liker 1â€“5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the Creators Pool allocated for that day. If you are a [Civic Liker](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/civic-liker),  you can largely affect the daily creators fund distribution by your claps to the content so that creators can earn extra income.

Furthermore, creators can check their [weekly, daily rewards](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creatortools/rewards) received from each article, they will also receive a Liker Land [monthly reports](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/creatortools/monthly-report) from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Readers can also send LikeCoin to the creator directly via [LIKE pay](https://docs.like.co/guides/wallet/like-pay).
