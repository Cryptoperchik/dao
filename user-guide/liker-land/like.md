# Like - Reinventing the Like

Any website embedded with a LikeCoin button can turn "Likes" into rewards, each clap can support the content creators and turn likes into actual income.

Using the [Liker Land mobile app to surf for articles](download.md), you can easily clap /"Like" and support the creators. When a [LikeCoin button](../creator/) is embedded in an article, it can be clapped by a Liker 1â€“5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the Creators Pool allocated for that day. If you are a [Civic Liker](../civic-liker/),  you can largely affect the daily creators fund distribution by your claps to the content so that creators can earn extra income.

Furthermore, creators can check their [weekly, daily rewards](../creatortools/rewards/) received from each article, they will also receive a Liker Land [monthly reports](../creatortools/monthly-report.md) from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Readers can also send LikeCoin to the creator directly via [LIKE pay](../../general-guides/wallet/like-pay.md).
