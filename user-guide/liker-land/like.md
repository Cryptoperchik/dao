# Like - Reinventing the Like

Any website embedded with a LikeCoin button can turn "Likes" into rewards, each clap can support the content creators and turn likes into actual income.

Likers who registered a [Liker ID](../liker-id/) can use the [Liker Land app to surf for articles](download.md), you can easily clap / "Like" and support the creators. When a [LikeCoin button](../creator/) is embedded in an article, it can be clapped by a Liker 1â€“5 times to reflect the degree of appreciation. Each clap represents a vote for the content, helping the creator receive part of the [Creators Fund](../civic-liker/creators-fund.md) allocated for that day.

If you are a [Civic Liker](../civic-liker/),  you can largely affect the daily [creators fund](../civic-liker/creators-fund.md) distribution by your claps to the content so that creators can earn extra income. Civic Liker has a special feature [Super Like](superlike.md) as well, clicking on the LikeCoin button for the 6th time can share your favourite, worth exploring contents to [depub.space](../depub.space/).

Furthermore, creators can check their [weekly, daily rewards](../creatortools/rewards.md) received from each article, they will also receive Liker Land [monthly reports](../creatortools/monthly-report.md) from the Foundation in order to understand their achievement.

Readers can also send LikeCoin to the creator directly via [LIKE pay](../../general-guides/wallet/like-pay.md).
