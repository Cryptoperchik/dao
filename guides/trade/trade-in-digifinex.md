The following instructions are base on DigiFinex web, you may also use [DigiFinex app](https://digifinex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000603862-How-to-download-APP) to trade LikeCoin.

### Step 1: Create your LikeCoin wallet on DigiFinex

First of all you have to create your wallet address on DigiFinex so as to transfer LikeCoin to the exchange. Click on the top right hand corner avatar icon and click "User Center", then click "My Balance". On the search box, input "Like", then click "Deposit"

This action brings you to the page "LikeCoin \(LIKE\) Deposit", click "Generate deposit address". You can also check your "Deposit History" underneath

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-14-en.png)

The address that starts with cosmos is your DigiFinex LikeCoin wallet just created, click on the "Show QR Code" so that you don't have to input the cosmos address manually. **Tag/Memo is very important** because it is mandatory for DigiFinex to identify your deposit

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-15-en.png)

Click on the "Show QR Code" button to show your LikeCoin wallet QR Code.

{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Transfer LikeCoin to DigiFinex

Open the [Liker Land mobile app](https://liker.land/getapp), click on the avatar at the lower right hand corner, and you can check the amount of LikeCoin in your wallet. Click on the \[Send\] button \(circled in red below\)

![On Liker Land mobile app select \[Send\] \(circled in red\)](../../.gitbook/assets/bitasset-trade-6.png)

Go to the next page, click on the QR Code icon circled in red, the app will open camera mode for you to scan the QR Code, please scan the QRCode that you have on Step 1, cause you have to transfer LikeCon to DigiFinex

![Click the QR Code icon circled in red to open camera](../../.gitbook/assets/bitasset-trade-7.png)

Input the Tag/Memo number into the "Input memo \(optional\)" field

{% hint style="warning" %}

### Step 3: Confirm the transfer to DigiFinex

You can check your wallet balance in "My Balance" following Step 1.

### Step 4: Buy or Sell

On the top left corner of DigiFinex website there are "Market" and "Spot" on the menu

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-17-en.png)

Click "Market", on the search box input "Like" will show the chart \(As LikeCoin is just into the market, there is no line graph at the moment\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-18-en.png)

Click "Spot", input "Like" to the search box on the left, click LIKE/USDT and goes into the exchange panel

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-19-en.png)

![LIKE/USDT panel](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-likeusdt-en.png)

Take a look at the order book on the right hand side. The figures in red are those orders who want to "Sell", for example below there are people who want to sell 424.57 LikeCoin at the price of 0.007200 USDT/LIKE, and then some other people want to sell 417.44 LikeCoin at 0.007300 USDT/LIKE. If you want to buy 500 LikeCoin, you can buy them all at 0.007300 USDT/LIKE

If you want to sell your LikeCoin, you have to monitor the seller in green. For example below if you want to sell 100 LikeCoin, it is guaranteed to be sold at 0.006600 USDT/LIKE because the highest selling price is 0.006600 to buy 151.07 LikeCoin

To make it simple, if you want to sell, check out the orders in green; if you want to buy, check out the orders in red. You can also take a look at the "Latest" transaction statistic

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-20-en.png)

Once you decide the price and amount to buy or sell, go to the "Spot" to confirm. Let use "Limit Price" as an example

You have to input 3 parameters:

* Select the right action for "Buy LIKE" or "Sell LIKE
* Input "Price": using the order book above as example, fill in 0.006600 for selling LikeCoin
* Input "Amount": Fill in 200 for selling 200 LikeCoin, or adjust the percentage e.g. 100%, 50%, etc

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-21-en.png)

The system will calculate "Total", confirm if they are correct or not, then click "Sell LIKE" to complete the transaction.
