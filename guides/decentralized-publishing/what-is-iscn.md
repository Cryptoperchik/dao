# What is ISCN

ISCN \([International Standard Content Number](https://iscn.io/)\) is the unique metadata record of a piece of content registered on LikeCoin chain. 

The use case of ISCN is like the ISBN \(International Standard Book Number\) when a book is being published.   The process of publishing content to LikeCoin chain is more or less the same: a unique ISCN is generated for each piece of content and bears corresponding metadata such as authors, publication date, copyright licenses and the digital fingerprint. ISCN data are immutable because of blockchain's characteristics.

ISCN data structure supports content versioning, each ISCN record will connect to it's previous version.

Register ISCN costs LikeCoin. it is the for the GAS fee and the cost for the application service provider.
