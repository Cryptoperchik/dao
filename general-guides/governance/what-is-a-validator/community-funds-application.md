You are encouraged to update your icon, website and intro on BigDipper, although it is not a mandatory requirement for applying for delegation. You are also welcomed to introduce yourself in the LikeCoin community call [https://docs.like.co/community-call](https://docs.like.co/community-call)

Please note validators' application for community fund cut off day is on the 15th 4:00a UTC+8 of each month. The committee will then process the applications in batch and make a decision by the 21st 4:00a UTC+8 of each month. Redelegation of community funds will take effect afterwards.&#x20;

#### Additional rules

I. Delegation will be allocated according to contribution and will not be on average out.

II. If the validator who got the community delegation is offline for more than a week and not replying to the cue from community members, their delegation will be revoked immediately.

### Renewal Procedure

Validators who receive their community delegation will have to re-apply again on the 6th month upon receiving their delegation.&#x20;

Validators have to _present a summary of what they have achieved in the past months_ to ensure that their delegation will be continued. Failing to comply will result in withdrawing the delegation. The committee will review and check if:&#x20;

1. The validator is always online.
2. The validator is active on Discord regarding the development of LikeCoin.
3. The validator promotes the identity of LikeCoin on other media/websites and communicates to their delegators.
4. The validator commission rate policy obligates the minimum commission rate and does make sense or not.
5. The validator participates in proposal voting.

The validator do work on what they promised on their #Validator Intro and consider the continuity of the delegation.&#x20;

Example: The validators who received the 1st round of delegation in June may re-apply again in November before the 15th, if they have 5 Aye from the committee they can keep the delegation. If the validator does not re-apply, the delegation will be withdrawn.&#x20;

The current Community Delegation Committee members are @chairoikominer, @Kcat, @sixwood, @Wright Fu, @yasu, @philipmak and @Daisy.
