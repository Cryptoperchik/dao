## Bank + Senator

A validator on LikeCoin chain is both a bank and a senator in Liker Land.

Operates a set of servers 24x7 to validate all transactions of Likers, including token transfers, content publishing, voting and etc.

### Validating Transaction \(Bank\)

In order to reach consensus in a community, some trusted parties have to record all transactions. In traditional world, this is performed by banks which charges various fees. In Liker Land, peer-to-peer transactions in general takes 5 seconds at extremely low cost.

### Raising a proposal and Vote \(Senator\)

Endorsement by Likers is reflected by delegation. When a Liker delegates her LikeCoin to a validator, she is trusting its technical ability, knowledge and integrity, and is letting it represent her.

## Validator Status

### Active Validator

The validator who performs its duty, and has the most of the delegated LikeCoin within the active validator numbers governed by the constitution.

### Inactive Validator

Validator does not perform its duty or "Jailed",  or doesn't have sufficient amount of LikeCoin delegation and is outnumbered by the active validators, governed by the constitution.
