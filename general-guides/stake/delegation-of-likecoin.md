# Delegation of LikeCoin

Delegation means delegating LikeCoin to one or more [validators](../governance/what-is-a-validator/), letting them to represent you to raise proposals and vote for or against the proposals, and most importantly to earn rewards. Since the LikeCoin chain upgraded to FoTan, Likers who delegate LikeCoin to validators can directly vote for proposals.
