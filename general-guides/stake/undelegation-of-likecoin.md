# Undelegation of LikeCoin

### **Undelegation of LikeCoin from your validator**

If you delegated LikeCoin to a validator but you want to get them back, you can utilize the \[Undelegate] function of [Liker Land app](https://liker.land/getapp). Please follow the steps:

1.   In the LikeCoin wallet page, click on the validator that you delegated (displayed as green)
2. Go to the validatior page, click \[Undelegate]
3. Input the number of LikeCoin that you have to withdraw, click \[Confirm]

### **Attention regarding Undelegation**

Once you've confirmed your undelegation, the following happens:

1. It takes 21 days cooling-off period to undelegate and get back the LikeCoin to your own wallet, the LikeCoin cannot be redelegated, rewarded or transferred as well.
2. Validator lost his/her voting power of the amount the LikeCoin withdrew.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[Transaction fee](../wallet/transaction-fee.md) is required for â€ŒUndelegate LikeCoin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you find that your LikeCoin undelegated was less than what you delegated to the validator, it may be the case that your validator [cannot validate the transaction properly](../../user-guide/background.md#9e68) and was penalized. Therefore, please choose your validator wisely.
