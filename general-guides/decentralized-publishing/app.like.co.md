# How to register a ISCN?

Users can go to [app.like.co](https://app.like.co/) and register an ISCN for their content and a unique image will be generated randomly. Even if there is a tiny little change to two pieces of similar content, the image for the ISCN will not be the same.

Registering ISCN to the LikeCoin chain will also upload the content to IPFS or Arweave. Users only have to pay a small amount of LikeCoin for registering and hosting.

Users can also check an ISCN record and it's details in app.like.co.
