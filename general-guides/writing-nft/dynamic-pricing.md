# Dynamic Pricing

We understand that writers prefer to focus on creation. Although there are unavoidable sales and promotion work such as building relationship with readers, sales effort should better be minimized.

Writing NFT helps creators to deal with two important sales parameters automatically: 1) marked price; 2) quantity.

The marked price of each Writing NFT will be adjusted automatically according to demand and supply, bounded by a predefined curve. Each new price point is double to the previous one. The pricing scheme seems to be simple to readers as well as there is only one marked price at any time. The marked price will be set to the lowest price in the secondary market if any.

There is no upper limit of Writing NFT quantity. Whenever someone collect an NFT at the marked price, a new NFT instance will be minted. As the marked price will be increased automatically as the minted quantity increased, the circulation limit will be in some sense set by the market when the marked price reaches an unacceptable value.
