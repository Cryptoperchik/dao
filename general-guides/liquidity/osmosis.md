## Providing liquidity to the liquidity pool

### Step 1: Select the liquidity pool

Currently LikeCoin install two liquidity pools in [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/):

[Pool #553 LIKE/OSMO](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/553)

[Pool #555 LIKE/ATOM](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/555)

On the menu of Osmosis select Pools and search for "LIKE". The following example is for pool 553.

### Step 2: Prepare your funds

Each Liquidity pool has its own ratio, Pool#553 LIKE/OSMO ratio is 50% / 50%, which means you have to prepare 50% LIKE to match with 50% OSMO.

### Step 3: Add Liquidity to Liquidity Pool

On the top left hand corner:

* **Pool Liquidity** is the total amount in the pool
* **My Liquidity** is the liquidity amount that you own in this pool
* **Bonded** is the liquidity that you bonded with this pool
* **Swap Fee** is the fee that people have to pay if they make a swap in the liquidity pool
* **Exit Fee** is the fee to withdraw funds from this pool.

Click "Add/Remove Liquidity"

On Manage Liquidity, fill in the amount of LIKE that you are going to put in the pool, the amount of OSMO will be automatically filled in.

If you would like to trade more funds for adding liquidity, click "Swap Token" at any time to trade.

Providing liquidity will receive a swap fee.

## Bonding LP Token for Liquidity Mining Incentives

After adding liquidity, you will receive LP Token according to the shares that you have provided in proportion to the whole liquidity pool. Bonding these LP Tokens will receive liquidity mining rewards.

### Step 1: Start Earning

Go to the right hand side of the screen and check out the Available LP tokens that you have, then click "Start Earning".

### Step 2: Bonded Liquidity Gauges

On Bond LP tokens there are three gauges: a day, 7 days and 14 days and they offer different APR, the longer the unbonding period the greater the APR. You can choose to bond all your LP Token to a 14 day gauge, or bond a different amount of tokens to different gauge. Input the number that you want to bond and click "Bond".

On My Bondings shows the number of tokens that you've bonded.

### Step 3: Rewards

On Daily Epoch 17:00 UTC, the liquidity mining rewards in OSMO will be automatically delivered to your Keplr wallet.

## Unbond LP Token and withdraw the funds

### Step 1: Unbond LP Token

Go back to My Bondings, on the gauge that to be unbonded, click "Unbond All".

Please note the unbonding period is the time that you selected the gauge, e.g. 14 days requires 14 days to completely unbond, 7 days requires 7 days to unbond. During the unbonding period, you can still earn liquidity mining rewards until you are fully unbonded.

### Step 2: Remove Liquidity and withdraw funds

Click "Add / Remove Liquidity", on Manage Liquidity select Remove Liquidity. You may select the full amount 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% to withdraw. Removing liquidity requires Exit fee, while you can get swap fee according to the proportion of your LP shares.

Click on the left menu and select Assets and check the amount of funds that you've withdrawn.
