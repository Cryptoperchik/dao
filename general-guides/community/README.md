# Community

As Liker Land grows, the community is vivid and alive too.

[LikeCoin Discord](http://discord.gg/likecoin) is for everyone, there are channels for development, governance, product discussion, etc. Validators and stakeholders exchange ideas and make Liker Land a better place together.

New users can go to the #read-first channel to learn about the nature of each Discord channel. Select the topic of interest in the #select-roles channel and click the "ä¸­" emoji to view the Chinese channel.

Moreover users can utilize the following functions on LikeCoin Discord:

* [#translate-wallet-prefix](translate-wallet-prefix.md) - Bilaterally check the old and new LikeCoin wallet address prefix
* [#faucet-test](faucet-testnet.md) - Get a small amount of LikeCoin for testing on testnet
* [#Community Call](community-call.md) - Join the monthly community call
