**statistics:**

* Facebook Ad CPA decreased by 20% to $67.88.  Tried to place AD to Chinese users in Canada, CPA on 1st day is very good \(&lt;$30\) but then increased to ~$100 after increasing the budget by 2.5 times.  The AD was temporarily suspended and will try again after the Easter holiday \(tonight\).
* Not much change in both Liker Land and LikeCoin button conversion funnel.  Weekly new Liker ID number stay around 2100+.  Weekly active Likers and Civic Likers number present a horizontal move.
* New civic liker registration: 85, has been dropping for the 2nd week since the March weekly peak 116

previous week:

* Published an article for [2020 Q1 review](https://matters.news/@likecoin/%E8%AE%9A%E8%B3%9E%E5%85%AC%E6%B0%91-2020-%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%AD%A3%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%A7-bafyreifdlfznigt3htdur7e2pyomoem5chmmortz34rnakprxdipt6s2vy).
* Planned for two weeks post listing strategy and schedule
* Social Media: Daisy started the community activity [LikeCoin 狂想曲](https://matters.news/@daisy/matters-%E7%A4%BE%E5%8D%80%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91%E9%85%8D%E6%8D%90%E6%8F%90%E6%A1%88-like-coin-%E7%8B%82%E6%83%B3%E6%9B%B2-bafyreiftbuickqne5bosrwweerr4znzsmhoygyipzlcv222l5glsekjvcm) on Matters

* Continue on Crisp migration

Social Media \(executed by community helper Daisy\)

* Facebook reach was down this week to 1028 \(prevous week 1819\) and engagement rate 5% \(previous week 6%\). Compared to last week that we had "super hot post Audrey Tang", this week's performance is back to "regular" as 2020 Q1 figures sharing started, which is much more "boring" in a sense.
*  Created a project in the Matters Million campaign to [collect crazy Likercoin usage ideas](https://matters.news/@daisy/like-coin-%E6%96%B0%E6%89%8B%E6%9D%91-%E4%B8%8D%E6%96%B7%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E8%AB%8B%E7%9C%8B%E7%95%99%E8%A8%80-zdpuAwHNTynzTx2Vi3Q487FNjSsacmzkRoiWpPjFgydW2gy6y) from Likers, total 32,825 LikeCoin raised. Project end day 30/4.
