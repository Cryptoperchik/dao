### 

* Social Media \(executed by community helper Daisy\)
  * Facebook reach last week was 949 and engagement rate 3%, compared to last week 1144 and 4% were relatively low. Topics of Likerthon seem not very engaging, maybe non-tech users were thinking that it  is not that related to themselves and skip. The coming week will focus on introducing ideas from each Likerthon team and the content will be more “layman”, hope things will become better.
