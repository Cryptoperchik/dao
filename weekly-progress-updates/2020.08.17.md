![Active App Likers](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2894%29.png)

![Active App users \(general\)](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2895%29.png)

* Civic Liker: 22 new registrations. 
* Total app download \(last 7d\): 207 \(-37.8%\)  
* Active Likers in app now is 132 \(weekly moving average\) and Active users in app now is 770 \(weekly moving average\).  The early target of _Super Like_ promotion is suggested to keep the active Likers satisfied, and convert the active app users \(most of them is believed to be creators using the wallet features\) to become Likers/SuperLikers.  By the past experience, email is not an effective way to reach the active app users though. Notifications and in app visual clues are the suggested alternatives.
* The Civic Liker's growing momentun is weak.  Boost could only be driven by advertisement but not natural conversion flow.  A detail review of the conversion path is recommended.
