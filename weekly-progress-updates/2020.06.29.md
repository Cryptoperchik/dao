### **Statistics**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2862%29.png)

* New app download **783** \(+377%\), unfortunately most of the new registrations are from app-bonus wash.  The figure was back to previous level last Friday after we deployed a bonus defer mechanism and keep banning the abusing-users.

### **Last week**

* Built an [open LikeCoin statistics](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/e6168171-b61d-4871-b39f-7b6308f2facc/page/qgR) portal by Google statistics.
* Managed the system abuse action attracted by the app referral program.  A few measurements is now effective:
  * banned Liker ID also banned its access and transfer function in Liker Land
  * deploy a stricter check before releasing the bonus
* Finished a new Civic Liker Ad creative, but Facebook has changed the ad policy therefore the ad cannot be launched.  Waiting for our Media partner to finish KYC.
* The Buy Civic Liker by LikeCoin campaign is on-hold due to technical bottleneck 
* Social Media \(executed by community helper Daisy\)
  * 

### This week

* App referral bonus campaign was on hold last week due to the loose defending mechanism against hacker.  We will relaunch the campaign this week after the fix is done.
* Follow up the Civic Liker ad campaign with Partners
* Content marketing around 7-1
