## **Content Jockey**

Standnews, InMedia, HKCNews and Matters help you to select [Today's headlines](https://docs.like.co/user-guide/reader/today-headline).

Artificial Intelligence helps on time saving and efficiency, but it doesn't work on news selection. Take Facebook as an example, although it's algorithms predict what arouses your emotions and interests you most, the intels are not important at all. Your newsfeed is long but the content may not be relevant to you, the information is lack of transparency and cannot be traced. Users really don't know that they have missed.

Pinpointing the problem of AI selection, Liker Land adopts "Zero AI curation strategy", readers select headlines recommended by Content Jockeys. Each content Jockey can choose 2 headlines per day. It encourages well chosen content so that the readers will not be flooded by useless information.
