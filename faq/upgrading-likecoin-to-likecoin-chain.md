# Upgrading LikeCoin to LikeCoin chain

This document is for those who fulfil the below conditions:

1. have LikeCoin on MetaMask
2. Have bound your Liker ID with at least one social accounts \(Google/Facebook/Twitter/Matters\) besides MetaMask

If you can **login Liker by MetaMask only**, you can still follow the below instruction except that you should choose "Login by MetaMask" in the upper left corner of the login screen, and you will be asked to setup a new password during the process.

LikeCoin has been migrated to LikeCoin chain and users no longer need MetaMask to login but should use Liker Land app instead.  This article is for legacy users which created Liker ID with MetaMask and have not finished the migration process only.
