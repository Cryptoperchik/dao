#### \[[Join **Civic Liker**](https://liker.land/civic)\]

Civic Liker is a movement to reward open contents. For the cost of a cup of coffee, you become a Civic Liker. Whatever you Like will then be turned into a tangible reward to creators.

## **Your interest, your taste**

The USD $5 paid monthly by a Civic Liker will be distributed to creators in full amount.\* Which creators to support purely depends on the online contents you Like during the month, while the Foundation distributes the reward based on your taste. You may check the distribution of rewards any time down to a cent on our panel.
